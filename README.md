## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with the TCP Server String Search, follow the instructions below. If you need the latest version, please visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/zakariye46/TCP-Server-String-Search/releases) to download the necessary files.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)

## Installation üì¶

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zakariye46/TCP-Server-String-Search.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd TCP-Server-String-Search
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use pip to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage üöÄ

To run the TCP server, use the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

You can specify the configuration file to customize the server's behavior. For example:

```bash
python server.py --config config.json
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The server's behavior can be customized using a configuration file. The following options are available:

- **port**: The port on which the server listens for incoming connections.
- **ssl_enabled**: Set to `true` to enable SSL encryption.
- **search_mode**: Choose the search algorithm to use (e.g., linear, binary).
- **data_file**: Path to the large file containing records for searching.

### Example Configuration File

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "ssl_enabled": true,
  "search_mode": "binary",
  "data_file": "data/records.txt"
}
```

## Testing üß™

To ensure the server operates correctly, run the tests included in the repository. Use pytest for this purpose:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests cover various aspects of the server, including performance and security checks.

## Performance üìà

The TCP Server String Search is optimized for speed and efficiency. It can handle thousands of simultaneous connections and perform searches in a fraction of a second, even with large datasets. 

### Benchmarks

The following benchmarks demonstrate the server's capabilities:

- **Linear Search**: 1,000 records searched in 0.5 seconds.
- **Binary Search**: 1,000 records searched in 0.1 seconds.

For detailed performance metrics, refer to the `performance.md` file in the repository.
